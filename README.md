# Angular CLI SSR diff

This is a repository for SSR application maintainers.
If you are looking for the differences in a classic CLI project, check out https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff

This repository exposes an Angular CLI app generated with
`ng new ponyracer --ssr`,
(starting from v17.0.0-next.6 when the option was introduced).

A dedicated branch per version makes changes very easy
to watch. For example:

* https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-ssr-diff/compare/18.1.0...18.2.0

See table below for the complete list.

Note that this is inspired by [RN diff](https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff).

This is a small project that we needed to keep our ebook [Become a ninja with Angular](https://books.ninja-squad.com/angular)
and our [online training about Angular](https://angular-exercises.ninja-squad.com) up to date,
we hope it can be useful for you too!

## Why this repository ?

After an upgrade of Angular CLI in your SSR application, you'll have to keep the configuration up-to-date, and it can be hard to keep track.

This project lets you easily know what changed. For example, from
[18.1.0 to the 18.2.0](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-ssr-diff/compare/18.1.0...18.2.0).
